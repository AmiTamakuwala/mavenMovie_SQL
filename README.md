Project to basic prectice of SQL, where we can understand about common MySQL Data types, Big 6 elements of sql like select, from, where, group by, having and order by.
distinct statement, where statement with it's operator.
GROUP BY function, we use JOIN statements to do multiple table querying( i.e. pulling data from multiple tables at once).This can be done using the same field(foreign  key) that exist in both the table which we are going to join.  
Normalization done also using JOIN.!
